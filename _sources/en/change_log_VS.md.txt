# Changelog | Vehicle Services

## 6.2.0

2025-01-29

### Highlights

* **Added support for the Info App in Vehicle Services:** Organizations using the Info App in Central Services can now access their information cards from Vehicle Services as well.

### Additional changes

* **Fixed a rare crash related to the Navigation app:** The navigation app could crash upon the Vehicle Services start in some rare cases, this should no longer be the case.
* **Fixed a bug related to the Route calculation failed pop-up:** The "Route calculation failed" pop-up that shows up when the Navigation app cannot route the vehicle to its destination could, in some rare cases, be un-dismissable. This should no longer be the case.
* **Fixed an issue with the Maps download:** Previously, a bug caused the Offline Maps download to happen even if the vehicle was on a metered connection (such as 4G or 5G), causing high data usage. This should now be fixed, the offline map download should only happen on Wi-Fi.


## 6.1.8

2025-01-14

### Highlights

* **The Tetra volume slider is now more responsive:** We have improved the handling of the Tetra call volume slider to make volume adjustments faster to apply on both Motorola and Sepura radios.


## 6.1.7

2024-12-11

### Highlights

* **The volume slider now adjusts the Phone call volume correctly:** A regression introduced in the previous version caused the "Voice" ("Röst") volume slider in Vehicle Services not to affect the Phone call volume, it was only adjusting the intercom volume. This should now be fixed and the slider should affect both intercom and Phone calls.

### Additional changes

* **Added a new log for raw GPS position in our support logs:** When you submit a support log through Vehicle Services, the vehicle raw GPS position will now be included in addition to the visible position in the Navigation app. This will allow us to help you better in situations of low GPS connectivity or when road data needs an update.

It displays vital information such as the state of the Tetra connectivity, the selected Talk group, Duplex and Simplex call status, multiple screen state, as well as general internet connectivity and time.
* **Intercom now supports dynamic volume control:** the intercom volume is now dynamically adjusted to prevent loud sounds from being heard.


### Additional changes

* **Intercom robustness has been improved:** the intercom should now be more robust to connection loss, such as when the devices are moved away from each other.
* **Improved robustness of certified apps:** certified apps will no longer lose SDK functionality in case of app reload.


## 5.3.2

2024-07-22

### Highlights

* **Updated Notification Handling:** We have listened to your feedback and improved the handling of notifications in Vehicle Services. Previously, it was difficult to tap on notifications and there was a risk of accidentally swiping them away. Now, we have optimized this feature to make it easier to tap on all notifications without accidentally swiping them away.
* **Full Support for Intercom:** Evam's SDK now fully supports Intercom, which is used by the Evam COMS application, among others.
* **Tetra PEI Available in Evam's SDK Even in Multiple-Screen Mode:** It is now possible to access the Tetra PEI interface through Evam's SDK, even in installations that use multiple-screen mode.


### Additional changes

## 5.3.1

2024-06-17

### Highlights

* **Added support for the Audio APIs in the Evam SDK:** It is now possible to use Audio-related APIs with the Evam SDK to select which audio device should be used for Telephone calls (device speaker, Bluetooth, etc).
* **Fixed an issue with the Units Tab in the Operations app:** While a case is active, the list of units that are on the same case is available in the Units Tab of the Operations app. Those units are retrieved from the dispatch data as well as Evam's Central Services, the latter also include their ETA to destination in minutes. This ETA was not displayed in previous version, and now should show properly.


### Additional changes

* **Fixed a rare crash when using the Search functionality:** A crash could occur when using the Search functionality of the Navigation app to start a trip, it should now be fixed.


## 5.3.0

2024-05-29

### Highlights

* **Customized Automated Talkgroup Switching:** We are excited to announce that you can now customize automated talkgroup switching to better meet your specific needs. 

    Previously, Vehicle Services always switched to the alarm's RAPS talkgroup when acknowledging the alarm, if one was available. With the new version, talkgroup switching can be customized based on different status messages and switch to chosen dispatched talkgroups, not just RAPS. Here are some examples of how you can configure this:

    *Acknowledge:* Switch to the dispatched talkgroup whose name contains "RAPS".
    
    *On Scene:* Switch to the dispatched talkgroup whose name contains "INS".

    It is also possible to switch to a talkgroup that is not sent out in the alarm, but is referenced from a dispatched talkgroups. For example, if "RAPS-1" refers to "INS-1", this mapping can be created and referenced in the talkgroup switches.

    Please note that this functionality is enabled behind a feature flag and the update will not affect your current configuration. If you are interested in accessing this new functionality, please contact support@evam.life.

* **Improved user experience related to Notifications and the use of more than two applications:** We have expanded the functionality for talkgroup switching in Vehicle Services for Airbus terminals. Previously, Vehicle Services could only handle talkgroup switching within the active talkgroup folder on Airbus terminals.

    Now, Vehicle Services can be programmed to handle both switching of talkgroup folders and individual talkgroups. This means that free talkgroup switching can be carried out regardless of the active talkgroup folder, providing greater flexibility and efficiency in your communication.

* **Continuous Improvement of Tetra Terminal Management Stability:** In version 5.3.0, we have further enhanced the stability in the management of Tetra terminals. The focus has been on optimizing the handling of simultaneous commands from various Vehicle Services apps, as well as potential interactions with the terminal's control head. These improvements aim to ensure a more robust and reliable performance.

### Additional changes
* **Operations app now opens correctly:** We've resolved a bug where the operations app would previously open in fullscreen instead of half-screen. The operations app will now consistently open in the correct screen mode.



## 5.2.4

2024-04-29

### Highlights

* **Added support for the Telephony APIs in the Evam SDK:** It is now possible to use Telephony-related APIs with the Evam SDK, including making phone calls, receiving them, and more generally managing their state.
* **Improved the User experience when receiving notifications:** Accepting an Operations-related Notification should now open the Operations app automatically.
* **Fixed an issue with the Report functionality:** Vehicle Services allows for a report to be sent if issues have been experienced. Previously, this report could be missing some data making the support more complicated. This should now be fixed.
* **Added support for injecting settings for a sideloaded certified app:** It is now possible to inject settings for your sideloaded certified app using the Demo Tool, see the documentation here: [Sideloaded Certified App settings](https://www.documentation.evam.life/tech/demo_tool_commands_reference.html#sideloaded-certified-app-settings).


### Additional changes

* **Removed limitation on sideloaded app ID:** Previously, when sideloading a certified app, its ID and URL would default to fixed values, which could cause challenges when integrating with some backend using CORS. This limitation has now been removed.
* **Fixed a sizing issue on the Galaxy Tab S7:** Previously, certified apps running on the Galaxy Tab S7 family of devices could end up looking more "zoomed-in" that they should. This is now fixed and the sizing should be now consistent across all supported devices.
* **Stability improvements for Navigation:** Closing an Operation should now properly clear the Navigation ETA and waypoints in the map should now be properly handled when manually added.
* **Stability improvements for Certified apps:** Certified apps could, under some rare circumstances, fail to load when Vehicle Services started or trigger some "Android Not Responding" popup. This should now be fixed.

## 5.2.3

2024-04-15

### Highlights

- **Stability improvements for Certified apps:** Previously, certified apps that attempted to reach unavailable servers could end up causing the certified app to be stopped by Vehicle Services. This should no longer be the case.

## 5.2.2

2024-03-27

### Highlights
- **Names of talk groups are now displayed in the same way as they are provided in the call-out from the dispatch central:** Previously, Vehicle Services has not always named talk groups with the same name as they are provided in the call-out from the dispatch central . For example, the application has translated the talk group "SjvIns" to "Insats". This has created some confusion. In the new version of Vehicle Services, the talk group "SjvIns" in the example above will be displayed as "SjvIns".
- **Numerous improvements to the Evam SDK for developers on the Evam platform:** We are constantly developing our SDK to provide our developers on the platform with better opportunities to develop applications. This includes:
    - The Operation units are now passed to the SDK
    - It is now possible for a certified app to request being put in the foreground
    - We now pass the USB health to the SDK
    - It is now possible for a certified app to play sound files
    - It is now possible for a certified app to remove a previously sent notification

### Additional changes

- **Simplified the ability to reload a third-party app:** An error message and a button to reload the app are now displayed in cases where a third-party application cannot be loaded.
- **Improved handling of talk groups:** The case app now correctly displays assigned talk groups even if a large number of talk groups are included in the same case.

## 5.2.0

2024-03-13

### Highlights
- **Automatically end navigation as part of a status change:** Today, navigation ends when you arrive at your destination. Users also always need to accept the card 'You have arrived at your destination.' With version 5.2.0, the ability to end ongoing navigation as part of a status change is introduced. One or more statuses can be configured to end ongoing navigation. This feature can be used to reduce the number of button presses and is also well-suited for, for example, command vehicles that typically do not go all the way to the scene of the incident.
- **The address is displayed on the map when you are within 200 meters of the destination:** To clarify the exact destination and expedite the response, the address of the destination appears in the navigation application when you are within 200 meters of the destination. This way, users can avoid having to open the case information in the operations app to confirm the house or gate number when arriving at the destination.

### Additional changes
- **Improved management of talk groups in alarm dispatch:** The operations app now correctly displays assigned talk groups even when a large number of talk groups are asigned with the case.
- **Enhanced handling of case priority:** The operations application's handling of alarms sent without a priority has been improved and is now managed without a visual bug in the operations application's priority field.



## 5.1.1

2024-02-26

### Highlights
- **The map layer "Vehicles on your case":** The map layer "Vehicles on your case," which displays all vehicles associated with the same case on the map, has been improved to support and function for all available formats and handling of SOS case numbers and case folders.
- **Stability improvements related to dispatch:** We have improved the handling of cases in the Operations application for situations where the GPS position of the event is missing in the alarm information. No navigation is initiated if the GPS position is not available in the case information. However, all other information, including any specified address in free text, will be displayed correctly.

### Additional changes

(none)


## 5.1.0

2024-02-14

### Highlights
- **Search for coordinates and navigate directly in the Navigation app:** It is now possible to enter GPS coordinates directly into the search field of the Navigation application in order to navigate to them. The search field can accept coordinates in both SWEREF 99 and WGS 84 Decimal formats. Longitude and Latitude can be separated by commas, spaces, or semicolons. When the coordinates are correctly formatted, they will appear as a search result from which navigation can be initiated.


### Additional changes

(none)


## 5.0.8

2024-02-06

### Highlights

- **The arrival experience in navigation is improved to provide support up to the exact position of the alarm:** Just as before, the navigation application will guide you along drivable roads as close as possible to the case's position. To enhance the quality of the case and offer support all the way to its position, such as in townhouse areas or terrain, the following improvements are made:
    -  A dashed line is added between the drivable road and the case's position.
    - Upon arrival at the last point on the drivable road, the dashed line will start indicating the direction between the vehicle and the case's position, and the map's zoom level will be adjusted to show both the vehicle's position and the case's position in the view. Meanwhile, the map's orientation (the vehicle's direction of travel or north) will be maintained based on the user's preference.
    - The dashed line will be displayed until the route is manually ended or the "You have arrived" card is dismissed.


### Additional changes

- The notification for a changed destination has been given a clearer title.
