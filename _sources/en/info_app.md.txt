## FAQ

<details>

<summary> Is the full information repository stored offline in the app on the tablet?  

</summary>

Once the user is mobilized to an incident, the app buffers the information linked to the active incident, as well as information related to the proximity of the incident destination. This ensures the user can access relevant information even in the event of a temporary mobile network outage.

Note that PDFs and images are not buffered and therefore require an active mobile network connection to be accessed.

The information repository can contain thousands of information cards, making it impractical to store the entire library offline in a smooth and efficient manner. Additionally, from a data security perspective, storing sensitive information unrelated to the ongoing incident is considered poor practice and may breach best practices for handling sensitive data.
