![Multiple screens](../_static/assets/img/png/installation_main_receiving.png)

One main screen and one or more receiving screens are installed in the vehicle. The main screen should be permanently connected to the vehicle's Rakel terminal. We recommend mounting the main screen as the driver's display.

Receiving screens can be used freely within and around the vehicle up to 50 meters from the vehicle, depending on the environment. 

When installing a multi-screen solution, first install the main screen and then all receiving screens.

    For the best driver environment, the driver's tablet should be mounted to the right of the driver and as high up as possible without obstructing the view. Aim for the driver to see the screen with just an eye movement. The need for head movement should be avoided.

    The tablet can be mounted in both horizontal and vertical orientations.
