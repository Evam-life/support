# Connectivity Setup Guide for Vehicle Services

## Why Connectivity Matters

Your Vehicle Services system works great even without an internet connection — that’s by design.  
But when connected, the experience becomes **faster, smarter, and smoother**.

Connectivity enables:
- ✅ Real-time updates and syncing between screens  
- ✅ Access to cloud features and support tools  
- ✅ Easy remote troubleshooting and software updates  
- ✅ Fewer manual steps and fewer errors  

In short: **offline works — online feels amazing.**

## Recommended Setup

To get the best experience, we recommend installing an **open SIM card** in each tablet.

### 🔓 Open SIM (Recommended)
- Quick setup, minimal maintenance  
- Reliable mobile data connection  
- Works out-of-the-box in most environments  

---

### 🔐 Private APN SIM (Optional)
If your organization requires private networking:
- A **Private APN** SIM can be used.  
- Some network openings and configurations are required — follow the official **Private APN Setup Guide**.  
- To receive that guide, please contact your **Project Manager**.

## Wi-Fi Usage Policy

Wi-Fi can be handy but is not always stable enough for connected Vehicle Services setups.

| Configuration | Wi-Fi Usage | Recommendation |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Single-screen setup** | Supported | ✅ Works, but mobile data is preferred for stability |
| **Multi-screen setup** | Not supported | 🚫 Do **not** use Wi-Fi — it may cause sync issues |
