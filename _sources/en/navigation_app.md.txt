### Starting a navigation
Starting a navigation can be made in four ways: 

- **Accepting a case:** Accepting a case with a destination automatically launches a navigation to the destination. 
- **Searching for a destination:** Search for a destination by clicking the magnifying glass in the top left corner. You can search for addresses as well as points of interest. 
- **Selecting destination in the address book:** The address book is configurable and may be reached through the magnifier glass icon in the top left corner of the navigation app.
- **Pinning a position in the map:** By pressing and holding somewhere in the map while you have no current active navigation you may launch a navigation to a pinned spot. 

### Map Mode
To toggle the map between following the car with the map oriented in North/South mode and the map oriented in the direction of travel you may change the map mode. The map mode is changed by pressing the map mode button marked below:

**Route Overview**

The route overview can be used to give and overview of the route to quickly understand where you are heading. If there are alternative routes these will be shown. However, the quickest route will always be pre-chosen. You may select the other route by pressing on it or starting to drive that route as the navigation app then automatically will adapt. 

Pressing "Center" will bring you back to follow the car again. 

**Destination Overview**

![Navigation destination overview](../_static/assets/img/png/navigation_destination.jpg)

The destination overview may be used to quckly zoom in on the destination to give you an overview of the site you are heading to. Take the possibility to start planning your first actions before you are at site. When in the destination overview mode you may change to a different map layer e.g. satellite images to get an even better overview of the site.  

Pressing "Center" will bring you back to follow the car again. 

### Adding a breakpoint or middle stop
Adding a breakpoint or middle stop can be made in two ways: 

**Option 1:** Through the dispatch.
The dispatch may include a breakpoint. This will be added as a middle stop in the navigation route and can be viewed and removed by expanding the route card.
