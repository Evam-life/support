Once paired in multiple screen mode the devices will share all data between the devices but the views (what you see on the screen) are completely independent from each other. For example: 
-	You may send a status from any screen in the setup. 
-	Changing the destination in the navigation app on one screen will change the destination on all screens. 
-	Opening one app on one screen will not open the same app on other screens – the views are independent.

**Loggin in or out to the TNA server:** By clicking on the TNA status field in the shortcut center you will bring up a list of the available and preconfigured callsigns to which you can log in. Clicking log in will log you in to the selected call-sign. A confirmation or any failure code will confirm the login status. 

**Getting logged out by another user:** If another vehicle logs in to the call-sign that you currently are logged in to you will be automatically logged out. The logged-out user will be notified about that it has been logged out through a notification and the status of the TNA status field in the shortcut center will be updated accordingly.
