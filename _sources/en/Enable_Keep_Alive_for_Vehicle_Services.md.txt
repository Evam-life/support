## General description

In Android, a keep-alive service usually refers to a background mechanism that ensures an app or process stays active (or at least wakes up regularly), even when the system would normally suspend or kill it to save battery and memory.

By default, Android aggressively manages apps in the background. If an app isn’t in use, the system may stop its background services. A keep-alive service prevents this by keeping a small, ongoing process running. This is often used for apps that need continuous operation. 

## Enable Keep-Alive for Vehicle Services

To enable Keep Alive, we need to first change your configuration. To do that, please reach out to Evam Support at support@evam.life.

Once you have received confirmation that your configuration has been changed, please follow these steps to enable Keep Alive:

1. **Close the application completely. Make sure it is not just minimized.**

2. **Restart the application. Once it has restarted, a pop-up window should appear. Select “Go to settings.”**

    *If the pop-up does not appear, skip ahead to Step 4.*
